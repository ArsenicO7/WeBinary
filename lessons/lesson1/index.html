                            <p class="text-muted mb-0">A number system, or numeral system, is how we name or represent numbers. A number system can be defined by its appearance and base. The appearance of a number system changes from culture to culture. For example, the number 1 in the Arabic number system does not look the same as the number 1 in the Chinese number system. A number system’s base defines how the numbers work mathematically, and most cultures in the world, including the English cultures, use a common number system of base 10 for algebraic mathematics.
                            </p>
                            <br />
                            <p class="text-muted mb-0">
                            The base of a number system defines how many values a single digit in the number system can hold. Our common numbering system allows each digit to contain the digits 0-9, which is a total count of ten digits. Hence, it is a base 10 numeral system.
                            </p>
                            <br />
                            <p class="text-muted mb-0">
                            While the base 10 number system is the one most commonly known and used for algebraic mathematics, there are other numbering systems used for different things. The two that will be primarily discussed in future lessons are binary, which is in base 2, and hexadecimal, which is in base 16.
                            </p>
                            <br />
                            <p class="text-muted mb-0">
                            The total number of possible combinations or the maximum value a number can hold for a number of digits is the number system base to the power of the number of digits. For example, in the base 10 number system, using two digits a number can have the range of 00 to 99, which is a total of 100 possible combinations. This is also equivalent to 10^2, or the number base to the power of the number of digits. While it is easy to simply see the number of combinations for the base 10 number system by looking at the maximum number, it can be more difficult for other number systems that aren’t as commonly used in algebraic mathematics, such as binary and hexadecimal.
                            </p>
                            <br />
                            <p class="text-muted mb-0">
                            As an example, let's say we have a number system of base 3. This means that the digits of all numbers can only have a value of 0, 1, or 2. If we are allowed to have up to 6 digits for a base 3 number value, then the number of combinations is the number of combinations from 000000 to 222222. While it is not obvious to figure out by simply looking at the number, the number of combinations can still be easily found by taking the base, 3, and putting it to the power of the number of allowed digits, 6. 3^6 is 729, so there are 729 possible combinations of values using six digits for a base three number system.
                            </p>
                            <br />
                            <p class="text-muted mb-0">
                            This may not seem useful, as when would one ever need to use this for an algebra or calculus problem? But in computer science, knowing the maximum number of values that can be stored in a certain number of digits is essential, especially memory management and manipulation. The entirety of how a computer manages data and operates is based on the manipulation of a limited number of digits in a numbering system, mainly binary and hexadecimal.
